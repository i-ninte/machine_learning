## first tutorial on sklearn 
#
'''
the numbetr of features is called dimensions
features are the columns used they act as input to the model and ae used to deetermine the right label. 
the labels depend on the features. they are the output of the featues 

features, attributes, independent variable, input
labels, output, dependent variable


the numberr of rows ==number of instances 
features ae represented by X and labels by y
features must be between   the range of -1 and 1



SAVING THE MODEL 
fom sklearn.externals import joblib 

then after training the model we create a filename with a .sav extension
filename= 'model.sav'
joblib.dump(clf, filenamme) clf cos it is a classification model we onytend to use in this case.



OPENING THE MODEL
remove all the codes used in savibng the model and 
clf= joblib.load(filename)




CLASSIIFICATION
grouping similar features under one label


TRAIN TEST SPLIT
 for splitting the data into test and training data
 we include from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
 
 
 then we create the variables X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test= train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.2)
this indicates that the size of the data used fo training is 20%
'''


SVM
support vector machine is used in high dimensional cases or cases where there are many features.

AREAS OF USAGE
Effective high dimensional spaces 
many kernel functions
classification and regression

it calculates the distance fromthe support vectors to the machine.
