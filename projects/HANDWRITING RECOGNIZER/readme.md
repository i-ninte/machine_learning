**Handwriting Recognizer Project**

Welcome to the Handwriting Recognizer project! This project is designed to recognize and transcribe handwritten text into digital form. Whether you're building an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system or a handwriting-based input method, this project provides the foundation to get started.

**Features:**

- **Preprocessing:** Our project includes preprocessing steps for enhancing the quality of handwritten text images. This can include techniques like noise reduction, binarization, and more.

- **Model Building:** We offer various models for recognizing handwritten text, including deep learning-based models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and traditional machine learning methods.

- **Training:** You can train your own models using custom datasets to improve recognition accuracy. We provide guidelines on collecting and annotating data.

- **Inference:** Use the trained models to recognize handwritten text in real time. This project includes scripts for easy integration into applications.
