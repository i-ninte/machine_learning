The project involves two main phases:

1. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - Data was scraped from the British Airways review site to gather customer reviews.
   - The collected data was prepared, processed, and cleaned to make it suitable for analysis.
   - Various insights were derived by analyzing the customer reviews, providing valuable information about customer sentiments and preferences.

2. **Machine Learning Model for Booking Prediction:**
   - The project's second phase focused on building a machine-learning model to predict whether a customer successfully booked a flight.
   - An analysis was conducted to understand customers' booking patterns and methods.
   - Data was scaled, transformed, and encoded to prepare it for modeling.
   - A Random Forest Classifier model was built to make predictions.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer sentiments, booking patterns, and a predictive model for flight bookings. The insights and model developed in this project can be valuable for British Airways in enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing booking processes.
