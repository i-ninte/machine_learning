# Speech Recognition Project README

This project implements a basic speech recognition system using the `speech_recognition` library. The goal is to capture audio input, perform speech recognition, and transcribe the spoken words using Google's speech recognition service.

## 1. Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
For Colab environment, additional setup may be required, and the pydub library may need to be installed differently.
```


## Usage
Import necessary libraries:


import speech_recognition as sr
Initialize the recognizer:


sr_obj = sr.Recognizer()
Capture audio and perform speech recognition:


with sr.Microphone() as source:
    # Adjust for ambient noise
    sr_obj.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=2)
    print("Speak now...")
    audio = sr_obj.listen(source)

    try:
        # Recognize speech using Google's speech recognition
        text = sr_obj.recognize_google(audio)
        text = text.lower()
        print("Did you say: " + text)

    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand the audio")

    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {0}".format(e))
## Local Environment
For local execution, make sure you have a microphone connected to your device. Adjust the microphone settings if needed.
## Colab Environment
If running in a Colab environment, the code provides a way to upload an audio file for processing. Make sure to upload the audio file when prompted.

## Acknowledgments
The project utilizes the speech_recognition library for speech recognition.
Google's speech recognition service is used for transcription.
Feel free to adapt and integrate this speech recognition system into your projects!
