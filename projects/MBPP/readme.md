# Personality Prediction Model using MBPP Theory

## Overview

This repository contains a personality prediction model based on the MBPP theory, which stands for "Myers-Briggs Personality Prediction." The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely recognized theory in psychology that categorizes individuals into one of 16 distinct personality types based on their preferences in four key dimensions. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that predicts an individual's MBTI personality type based on various input features.

## MBPP Theory (Myers-Briggs Personality Prediction)

### What is MBPP?

The MBPP theory is based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a psychological framework developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers. The MBTI theory categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types, each characterized by preferences in four key dimensions:

1. **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)**: This dimension reflects how individuals focus their attention. Extraverts are outward-focused, while introverts are inward-focused.

2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**: This dimension represents how individuals gather information. Sensors rely on concrete data, while Intuitives rely on abstract concepts and possibilities.

3. **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**: This dimension describes how individuals make decisions. Thinkers use logical analysis, while Feelers consider emotional and interpersonal aspects.

4. **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)**: This dimension reflects how individuals deal with the outside world. Judgers prefer structure and organization, while Perceivers are more flexible and adaptable.

### The Model

The personality prediction model in this repository utilizes machine learning techniques to predict an individual's MBTI personality type based on various data sources, such as text data, social media posts, or survey responses. The model takes these inputs and, after processing and feature extraction, predicts the most likely MBTI personality type for the individual.
