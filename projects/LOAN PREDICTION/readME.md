# Loan Predictor

## Overview

The Loan Predictor is a machine learning project designed to assist in predicting whether a loan application is likely to be approved or denied. This project leverages a dataset of historical loan applications, including various attributes such as credit score, income, and loan amount, to build a predictive model to save time and streamline the loan approval process.

## Project Goals

- Develop a robust machine learning model to predict loan outcomes accurately.
- Increase the efficiency of loan application processing.
- Reduce the manual effort required for loan approval.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and processed, and missing values are handled.
- Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model is trained using historical loan data.
- Prediction: The model predicts loan outcomes for new applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Usage

To use the Loan Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Open the Loan Predictor application.
2. Enter the required applicant details, such as credit score, income, and loan amount.
3. Click the "Predict" button to receive a prediction on whether the loan is likely to be approved or denied.
